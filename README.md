## Summary
A quick proof of concept for a system where the player is presented with a dialogue at mission start. The dialogue offers a selection of enemy factions. By selecting a faction, code can reference the selected faction in order to replace units with the appropriate faction.
The idea behind this is that by using a similar dialogue, large mission areas can be quickly filled with appropriate unit types and can be quickly adapted to different maps, time periods or enemies.
